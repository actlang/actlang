# actlang
ActLang is a modern functional programming language to build highly distributed applications for BEAM Virtual Machine. Inspired by Erlang's process and Akka Toolkit's Actor-based concurrency model. Actlang is a general-purpose language that makes programming fun and simpler from learning to building enterprise-grade solutions. If you are already familiar with FP paradigm for languages like Haskell, Clojure, Scala e.g, you found actlang easier to start with

# Background & Motivation

A Statically Typed language with all modern features to create stable, less error-prone applications for battle tested Erlang based systems. To make programming easeir for new developers by utilizing the features of functional programming like:
Declarative Style ( what, not how) , Functions as first class citizens ( higher-order functions, transformations), immutability, basic algebric data types e.g.
</br>

Another goal of actlang is to provide a fantastic developer experience. Simply put, developers should be both highly productive and experience joy when programming. Making them free from the major problem of concurrency: "Shared Mutable State", to build a fault-tolerant system that supports the paradigm: "Let It Crash"
</br>
Unlike other programming languages and compilers, ActLang is built around the concept of early-compilation. Avoiding programmers to make bad logical mistakes.

We have some talk sessions in plan. When a video of the talk is available, we will post it here!
